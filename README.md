# sql-challenge

This project involved designing and implementing a SQL database to analyze employee data from the 1980s and 1990s for Pewlett Hackard. It began with creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to model the database structure, followed by defining table schemata for the six provided CSV files and importing the data into a PostgreSQL database. The tables, which include `employees`, `departments`, `dept_emp`, `dept_manager`, `salaries`, and `titles`, were created with primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity.

The final phase of the project focused on writing SQL queries for data analysis. These queries covered tasks such as listing employee details, identifying employees hired in 1986, retrieving department managers, and calculating the frequency of last names. The project successfully demonstrated how to retrieve and analyze data from the relational database, with all SQL code and the ERD image organized in the repository.
